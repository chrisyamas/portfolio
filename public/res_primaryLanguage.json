      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Christopher Yamas, and I am a Software Developer with a focus and proficiency in both Python and JavaScript. In my prior experience as a director of political campaigns, I was frequently commended by my peers and superiors for being solutions-oriented, as well as steadfast in my commitment to a psychologically safe team culture. Along the way, I gained a greater desire for career stability and more dynamic hard skills, which has led me to software development through object-oriented programming languages. In terms of my current career goals, Iâ€™m eager for the opportunity to help advance life-enriching technologies for an industry-leading firm that has a net-positive environmental impact.",
